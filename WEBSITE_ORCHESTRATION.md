# Website Orchestration Documentation

This document outlines the workflow and steps taken to create the personal website.

## 1. Project Goal

The initial request was to "Create a personal website with blog, product reviews, and about sections, featuring a modern, responsive, blue-themed design, SEO considerations, and placeholder images."

## 2. Initial Planning & Development (by Architect Mode)

The initial task was delegated to Architect mode for planning and foundational development. Architect mode proceeded to build the basic site structure using React, Vite, and Framer Motion. This included creating essential pages (Home, Blog, Reviews, About, etc.) and shared components.

## 3. User Feedback & Refinements

Following the initial build, the user provided feedback and requested several refinements:
*   Use Unsplash for navy-blue, wide placeholder images.
*   Implement a wider website frame for a more expansive feel.
*   Style the brand name "numan syed" with "numan" and "syed" in different colors.
*   Implement light and dark color themes for user preference.

## 4. Development Updates (by Code Mode)

The task to implement these refinements was delegated to Code mode. Code mode successfully implemented the requested features, including the wider layout, distinct styling for the brand name, light/dark mode functionality, and the integration of Unsplash placeholder images.

## 5. Documentation Updates (by Code Mode)

Code mode was also tasked with updating the [`README.md`](README.md) file to include comprehensive project details, the technology stack used, and clear setup instructions. This update was successfully completed.

## 6. Final Orchestration Documentation (by Architect Mode - this current task)

This `WEBSITE_ORCHESTRATION.md` file has been created by Architect mode to document the overall workflow, development stages, and mode contributions involved in creating the personal website.
